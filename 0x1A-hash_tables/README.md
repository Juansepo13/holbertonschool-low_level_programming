### General
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the C standard library
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called hash_tables.h
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

### More Info


```/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
  *
   * @key: The key, string
    * The key is unique in the HashTable
     * @value: The value corresponding to a key
      * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
       */

	         char *value;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash t	able data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
